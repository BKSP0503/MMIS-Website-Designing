<label for="tenth">Landslide Hazard Zonation using GIS:<span>&#x3e</span></label>
<input type="radio" name="accordion" id="tenth">
<div class="content">
	<p>Landslide hazard zonation is the process of ranking different parts of an area according to the degrees of actual or potential hazard from landslides. The evaluation of landslide hazard is a complex task. It has become possible to efficiently collect, manipulate and integrate a variety of spatial data such as geological, structural, surface cover and slope characteristics of an area, which can be used for hazard zonation. The entire above said layer can well integrate using GIS and weighted analysis is also helpful to find Landslide prone area. By the help of GIS we can do risk assessment and can reduce the losses of life and property.</p><br>

<input type="radio" name="accordion" id="eleventh">
<div class="content">
	<p>Land cover means the feature that is covering the barren surface .Land use means the area in the surface utilized for particular use. The role of GIS technology in land use and land cover applications is that we can determine land use/land cover changes in the different areas. Also it can detect and estimate the changes in the land use/ land cover pattern within time. It enables to find out sudden changes in land use and land cover either by natural forces or by other activities like deforestation.</p></br>

<input type="radio" name="accordion" id="twentyseventh">
<div class="content">
	<p>Water availability for irrigation purposes for any area is vital for crop production in that region. It needs to be properly and efficiently managed for the proper utilization of water. To evaluate the irrigation performance, integrated use of satellite remote sensing and GIS assisted by ground information has been found to be efficient technique in spatial and time domain for identification of major crops and their conditions, and determination of their areal extent and yield. Irrigation requirements of crop were determined by considering the factors such as evapotranspiration, Net Irrigation Requirement, Field irrigation Requirement, Gross Irrigation Requirement, and month total volume of water required, by organizing them in GIS environment.
